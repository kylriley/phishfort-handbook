# Fair Use Doctrine

The fair use doctrine allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, education, or research.

> 📘 **Note**
>
> **Fundamental Principle**: Fair Use shouldn't cause confusion to users/customers—there isn't brand impersonation involved.

## Types of Fair Use

### Classic Fair Use

Using a trademark to describe goods or services **without indicating their source**.

**Purpose**: Help prevent monopolies on descriptive terms.

**Example**: "iPhone-compatible charger" (describing compatibility, not claiming to be Apple).

### Nominative Fair Use (Most Common)

Allows use of another's mark to identify their goods/services when they cannot be easily identified otherwise.

**Example**: Media outlets referring to trademarked names for reporting purposes (provided there's no false affiliation suggested).

## When Does Fair Use Apply?

Fair use applies when the mark is used in **good faith** without causing **consumer confusion**.

### Protected Scenarios

✅ **News Reporting**
- Referring to trademarks in news stories or commentary.
- Information provided must be accurate.

✅ **Product Reviews**
- Mentioning brand names to identify products for review.
- Includes critical reviews.

✅ **Parody**
- Protected by U.S. law and many other countries.
- Typically doesn't confuse consumers.

✅ **Comparative Advertising**
- Comparing products can include trademarks.
- Must be non-deceptive.

✅ **Compatibility Claims**
- Stating product's compatibility with another brand.
- "Works with [Brand]".

✅ **Identifying Customers**

- Only as much as necessary.

## Requirements for Fair Use
