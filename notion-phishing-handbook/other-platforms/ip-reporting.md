# IP Reporting

Reporting IPs requires extra care and detailed evidence due to the complexities of their use.

> ⚠️ **Warning**
>
> **Important**: Many IP addresses host multiple websites, and not all may be malicious.
>
> Domain-level takedowns are usually **more effective** than targeting entire IPs.

## Evidence Requirements

✅ **Specific URL Evidence**
- Always provide a specific URL associated with the malicious activity hosted on the IP.

✅ **Detailed Explanation**
- Describe how the content is harmful or infringing.
- Include proof of malicious activity (phishing, malware, impersonation).

## Domain vs. IP Considerations

> 💡 **Tip**
>
> **Best Practice**: If the same domain is used across multiple IPs, prioritize reporting the **domain** rather than the IPs.
>
> When a TLD is taken down, it cannot change IPs to be up again.

### When to Report IPs
- Single-IP hosting with multiple malicious domains.
- Infrastructure hosting only malicious content.
- When domain takedowns have failed.

### When NOT to Report IPs
- IP hosts legitimate websites alongside malicious ones.
- Domain-level takedown is possible.
- Risk of collateral damage to legitimate sites.

## Malware & Sensitive Content

> 🚨 **Danger**
>
> Cases involving **malware** or **NSFW material** demand heightened attention.
>
> Please clearly flag these cases when reporting so our analysts can prioritize and handle appropriately.
