# Search Engine Cache Removal

When unwanted or malicious content continues to appear in search results—even in cached form—you can request removal of those cached versions.

## How Cached Removal Works

> ⚠️ **Warning**
>
> **Prerequisite**: Before a search engine will remove a cached page, the content must actually be **unavailable on the live site** (returns 404 or has been taken down).

### The Recrawl Process

Search engines use bots (crawlers) to discover and index content. When a page is updated/deleted:
1. Crawler must recrawl the page.
2. This can take **days or even a week**.
3. Depends on site popularity and crawl frequency.
4. Can be expedited with cache-specific reports.

## Evidence Requirements

✅ **Exact URL** as it appears in search results.
✅ **Search Engine Name** (Google, Bing, etc.).
✅ **Cached-Page URL** (if available).

> 📘 **Note**
>
> **Important**: Report each cached link as a **separate incident** (one URL = one incident), even if same search term appears across multiple engines.

## Best Practices

✅ Ensure live page is already down/removed.
✅ Submit to each search engine separately.
✅ Include exact cached URL when available.
✅ Provide context about the original takedown.

❌ Don't submit while live page is still active.
❌ Don't expect instant removal.
❌ Don't bundle multiple URLs in one report.
