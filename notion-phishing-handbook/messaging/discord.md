# Discord Takedowns

Discord presents unique requirements for takedown cases due to its structure, where users, messages, and servers all have distinct identifiers.

## How to Obtain IDs and Links

1. Go to the specific user, message, or server causing the issue.
2. Right-click on the element (e.g., user profile or message).
3. Select the three dots and click **"Copy Link"**.

### Example Message ID Structure

`https://discord.com/channels/XXXXXXX/YYYYYYY/ZZZZZZZ`

Where:
- **XXXXXXX** = Server ID.
- **YYYYYYY** = Channel ID.
- **ZZZZZZZ** = Message ID.

## Evidence Requirements
