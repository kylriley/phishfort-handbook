# Bulk Reporting

For certain social media platforms, we offer bulk reporting functionality.

## Requirements

All of the following must be met:

- ✅ **Same Platform**
  - All URLs must be from the same platform.

- ✅ **Same Brand/Person Targeted**
  - All incidents target the same brand or person.

- ✅ **Similar/Same Attack Pattern**
  - Example: All are fake customer support accounts.

## Supported Platforms

- Facebook.
- Instagram.
- Scribd.
- GitBook.
- Teachable.
- Telegram.

> 📘 **Note**
>
> This list is not exhaustive. If unsure whether bulk reporting is supported for a specific platform, contact PhishFort Support.

## How to Submit Bulk Incidents

### Submission Format

You may include **up to 10 URLs**:
- **1 primary URL** in the incident form.
- **Up to 9 additional URLs** in the incident comments.

### Process

1. **Create incident** with type set to **"social"**.
2. **Add primary URL** in the main form.
3. **Add remaining URLs** (up to 9) in comments.
4. **Provide evidence** for all reported cases.

## How We Evaluate Success

### Success Criteria

- ✅ **At least 1 URL successfully taken down** = Incident marked successful.
- ❌ **No URLs successful** = Incident not marked successful.

### Failed URLs

- Our Operations team will notify you of failed URLs.
- **Resubmit failed URLs** in new incident for another attempt.
- **Cannot re-report in bulk** - must be individual incidents.

## Important Limitations

⚠️ **Domain Bulk Reporting NOT Available**

> 🚨 **Danger**
>
> **Important**: Bulk reporting of domains is **not available** at this time.
>
> Do **NOT** include domain-level takedown requests in bulk social submissions.

Each domain must be submitted as a separate incident.

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This
- Verify all URLs are from same platform.
- Ensure same attack pattern.
- Provide evidence for each URL.
- Submit as "social" incident type.
- Include context in comments.

### ❌ Don't Do This
- Don't mix platforms in one submission.
- Don't exceed 10 URLs.
- Don't include domains in social bulk reports.
- Don't resubmit failed URLs in bulk again.
- Don't submit without evidence.

## Example Bulk Submission

**Scenario**: 7 fake Facebook customer support accounts

**Submission**:
- **Platform**: Facebook.
- **Pattern**: All claim to be official customer support.
- **Primary URL**: (in main form).
- **Additional 6 URLs**: (in comments).
- **Evidence**: Screenshots, LOA, legitimate profile link.
- **Context**: "All 7 accounts are impersonating our customer support, using our logo, and scamming customers".

## When NOT to Use Bulk Reporting

- Different platforms (submit separately).
- Different attack patterns (may need different evidence).
- Already failed once (resubmit individually).
- Domains (not supported for bulk).
- More than 10 URLs (split into multiple submissions).
