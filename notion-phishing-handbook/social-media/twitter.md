# Twitter/X Takedowns

Choosing the right evidence for X/Twitter cases is crucial. X has a clear and strict definition of impersonation that must be met for successful takedowns.

> ⚠️ **Warning**
>
> **Critical Requirement**: X/Twitter impersonation must meet **at least 2** of the following criteria:
> 1. Display name.
> 2. Profile description.
> 3. Impersonating post.
>
> If these criteria are not met, they **will reject** the takedown.

## Strict Impersonation Definition

### What Counts for Impersonation

| ✅ Counts | ❌ Does NOT Count |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Display name** (the name shown on profile). | Username (@handle). |
| **Profile description** (bio). | |
| **Impersonating post** (must provide link). | |

> 📘 **Note**
>
> **Important**: The username (@handle) is **not** considered for impersonation on Twitter/X!
>
> Only the display name, bio, and posts matter.

---

## Evidence Requirements

### Mandatory Evidence

✅ **Letter of Authorization (LOA)**

✅ **Meet 2+ Impersonation Criteria**
- Display name uses your brand.
- Profile description claims affiliation.
- Posts claim to represent your brand.

✅ **Context and Brief Description**
- Type of impersonation.
- How it harms your brand.
- Any customer reports.

### Optional But Recommended

- **Legitimate Profile** (helpful but optional for impersonation).
- **Screenshots** showing:
  - Profile with display name visible.
  - Bio/description.
  - Impersonating posts.
  - Engagement/confusion.

### Only for Cases WITHOUT Logo

If the fake account does NOT use your logo as profile picture:

✅ **Screenshots or Proof of Impersonation**
- Must clearly show 2+ of the criteria.
- Must be undeniable impersonation.

---

## Types of Twitter/X Violations

### 1. Profile Impersonation

**Qualifying Example** (meets 2+ criteria):
- ✅ Display name: "CustomerSupport  BrandName".
- ✅ Bio: "Official support for BrandName products".
- Profile picture: Generic image (not your logo).

This meets 2 criteria (display name + bio) = **Actionable**

**Non-Qualifying Example** (meets only 1):
- ❌ Display name: Regular person's name.
- ✅ Bio: "I work at BrandName".
- Profile picture: Personal photo.

This meets only 1 criterion = **Not Actionable**

---

### 2. Impersonating Posts

If the profile itself doesn't meet impersonation criteria, but posts do:

**Evidence Needed**:
- Link to the specific impersonating post.
- Screenshot of the post.
- Explanation of false claims.

**Example Post**:
> "This is the official BrandName account. We're giving away prizes! DM us your details."

---

### 3. Trademark Violations

If impersonation criteria aren't met, you may report as trademark violation instead.

**Evidence Needed**:
- Trademark registration documents.
- Proof of unauthorized TM use.
- LOA matching the trademark.
- How it creates consumer confusion.

---

## Gathering Evidence for Twitter/X

### For Profiles

1. **Screenshot the entire profile** showing:
   - Display name (top of profile).
   - @username (for reference, though not counted).
   - Bio/description.
   - Profile picture.
   - Header image.

2. **Copy the profile URL**:
   - `https://twitter.com/username` or
   - `https://x.com/username`

### For Posts

1. **Get direct link to the post**:
   - Click the post timestamp.
   - Copy URL from address bar.

2. **Screenshot the post** showing:
   - Full post text.
   - Display name.
   - Timestamp.
   - Engagement metrics.

---

## Common Rejection Reasons

### Only Username Matches
**Problem**: Only the @handle is similar, but display name is different

**Solution**: Not actionable unless display name or bio also qualifies.

### Only 1 Criterion Met
**Problem**: Either display name OR bio matches, but not both, and no impersonating posts

**Solution**: Find impersonating posts to meet the 2-criterion minimum.

### LOA Issues
**Problem**: Missing or incomplete Letter of Authorization

**Solution**: Provide complete LOA with all required information.

### Profile Description Doesn't Claim Affiliation
**Problem**: Bio mentions the brand but doesn't claim to represent it

**Example of NOT qualifying**:
> "Love BrandName products! Unofficial fan account"

**Solution**: Report as trademark violation instead if applicable.

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

1. **Verify 2+ Criteria Before Submitting**
   - Count how many criteria are met.
   - Don't submit if less than 2.

2. **Provide Links to Impersonating Posts**
   - Direct links to specific posts.
   - Shows clear false claims.

3. **Include Legitimate Profile**
   - Helps show comparison.
   - Proves your official presence.

4. **Explain Customer Confusion**
   - Show how users are misled.
   - Include customer reports if available.

### ❌ Don't Do This

1. **Don't Submit Based on Username Alone**
   - @username doesn't count.
   - Will be rejected.

2. **Don't Submit with Only 1 Criterion**
   - Must meet minimum of 2.
   - Save time by checking first.

3. **Don't Confuse Mentions with Impersonation**
   - Mentioning your brand ≠ Impersonation.
   - Must claim to BE or represent you.

4. **Don't Skip Context**
   - Explain why it's harmful.
   - Show potential for confusion.

   - Was evidence clear?

2. **Strengthen the case**
   - Find impersonating posts.
   - Get more screenshots.
   - Document customer confusion.

3. **Consider different violation type**
   - Try TM instead of impersonation.
   - Try copyright for specific content.
   - Try spam/scam reporting.

4. **Resubmit with improvements**
   - Address rejection reasons.
   - Provide clearer evidence.
   - Add more context.
