    "content": "Domain Incidents Attacks using malicious or deceitful domains are a significant portion of what we deal with in the brand protection environment. A single domain can host multiple types of violations, and depending on the violation, the required evidence might change. Most Important : Provide steps to reproduce the attack (Live Proof) so our analysts can easily access the domain and gather further information. Essential Evidence for All Domain Cases When reporting a domain incident, provide: 1. Direct Links with Evidence Provide links with evidence of the infringement, such as: Payment tracking numbers leading to pages with violations. Specific paths showing malicious content. Direct URLs to phishing forms. 2. Screenshots Screenshots showing: Phishing forms or other harmful content. Full URL visible in the address bar. Date and time visible (important for verification). 3. Context About the Case Describe: How it was discovered. Where it was found (search engine, email, social media, etc.). Device and browser used. Location/IP used to access. Any other relevant details. 4. Geo-Fencing Information If you suspect the attack is geo-fenced (only visible from certain locations), also provide: Browser used. Geographic location. Device type (desktop/mobile). IP address if available. Quick Summary: Minimum Evidence Required For all domain-related cases, you must provide: Full URL (e.g., ) Screenshots showing the infringement with date, time, and full URL Case description (context, how found, relevant details) Location, device, and browser used to observe the attack Once submitted, an analyst may contact you for additional details if necessary. Types of Domain-Related Incidents 1. Website Brand Impersonation This occurs when the domain pretends to be the victim's brand, for example, by claiming to be the \"official\" website. Evidence Required: ✅ Screenshots of the webpage showing brand assets and the full URL. ✅ Screenshots of any statements from the attacker claiming to repre"

    "content": "Email Attacks To execute takedowns of phishing emails or malicious email addresses, we need the original email headers . This is the single most important piece of evidence for email-based attacks. Why Email Headers Are Critical Every Internet email message is made up of two parts: The Header - Technical routing and authentication information The Body - The visible message content What Email Headers Contain A full and valid email header provides a detailed log of: The network path taken by the message. Mail servers involved in transmission. Authentication results (SPF, DKIM, DMARC). Sender IP addresses. Timestamps for each hop. Routing information. Critical : Your email client usually hides the full header or displays only basic lines like From, To, Date, and Subject. You must extract the complete raw headers . Common Mistake: Don't Forward Emails! Never forward emails as evidence! Every time you forward an email, the email headers are replaced with new ones. This destroys the original evidence we need to trace the attack. Instead, Extract the Raw Headers The process varies by email client, but generally: Open the email. Look for options like: \"Show Original\". \"View Source\". \"Message Source\". \"Raw Message\". \"View Headers\". Copy the complete raw text. Save as a or file. For detailed instructions on how to extract headers from your specific email client, see our Email Headers Guide or search online for \"[Your Email Client] view email headers\". Evidence Required for Email Attacks Mandatory Evidence ✅ Email Headers (Raw/Original) Must be from the original email (not forwarded). Complete headers from start to finish. Preferably saved as file. Can also be provided as text format. Optional But Helpful Evidence Screenshots of the email showing: Sender information. Subject line. Email body with malicious content. Any embedded links or attachments. Date and time received. Context about the attack: How widespread is the campaign. Number of recipients affected. Type of scam (cr"

    "content": "What Makes Evidence Stronger, and What is Not Actionable Understanding what constitutes strong evidence versus counter-evidence is crucial for successful takedown requests. This guide helps you distinguish between actionable violations and legitimate use cases. Brand Impersonation Brand impersonation , or brand spoofing, is a phishing tactic that involves cybercriminals falsely representing themselves as your organization or one of your organization's employees. Evidence vs. Counter Evidence ✅ Strong Evidence ❌ Not Actionable / Counter Evidence Usage of the victim logo as its own logo. Having own logo / using victim logo somewhere in content. Use client name as own in page title, main header, footer (c). Mention brand as category or subpage related to service provided. Clearly state to be official support / helpdesk / other department of victim brand. Say that they can help with something, without pretending to be official Representative. Account use name/photo/position of official employee. Former worker; Same name, but not related. Competitors or similar businesses, especially when brand name is very generic. Key Distinction : Brand impersonation requires the bad actor to actively pretend to BE the brand, not just mention or reference it. Trademark and Copyright Infringements TM/CR infringements are not part of brand impersonation (as impersonation is malicious and more powerful evidence). In summary, trademark and copyright infringements include all uses that are not \"fair\" or \"nominative\" use. Learn more about Fair Use Doctrine and Trademark & Copyright Fair Trademark Usage For usage to qualify as fair trademark use : The use of the plaintiff's mark is necessary to describe their goods or services. They use only as much of the mark as is necessary to describe the product. Their conduct reflects the accurate relationship they have with the plaintiff. Nominative Trademark Usage For nominative trademark usage , the following elements must be present: The use must a"

    "content": "Fair Use Doctrine The fair use doctrine allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, education, or research. Fundamental Principle : Fair Use shouldn't cause confusion to users/customers—there isn't brand impersonation involved. Types of Fair Use Classic Fair Use Using a trademark to describe goods or services without indicating their source . Purpose : Help prevent monopolies on descriptive terms. Example : \"iPhone-compatible charger\" (describing compatibility, not claiming to be Apple). Nominative Fair Use (Most Common) Allows use of another's mark to identify their goods/services when they cannot be easily identified otherwise. Example : Media outlets referring to trademarked names for reporting purposes (provided there's no false affiliation suggested). When Does Fair Use Apply? Fair use applies when the mark is used in good faith without causing consumer confusion . Protected Scenarios ✅ News Reporting Referring to trademarks in news stories or commentary. Information provided must be accurate. ✅ Product Reviews Mentioning brand names to identify products for review. Includes critical reviews. ✅ Parody Protected by U.S. law and many other countries. Typically doesn't confuse consumers. ✅ Comparative Advertising Comparing products can include trademarks. Must be non-deceptive. ✅ Compatibility Claims Stating product's compatibility with another brand. \"Works with [Brand]\". ✅ Identifying Customers Using partner logos in marketing. Only as much as necessary. Requirements for Fair Use Fair Trademark Usage To qualify as fair trademark use: Necessary for Description Use of plaintiff's mark must be necessary to describe goods/services. Minimal Use Only amount necessary for description should be used. Accurate Relationship Usage must reflect true relationship between user and plaintiff. Nominative Trademark Usage To qualify as nominative use: Accurate Reference Must accurately refer to TM owner"

Coverage ✅ Covered TLDs : .com, .org, .net. ❌ NOT Covered : Country code TLDs (ccTLDs) like .sa, .ru, .fr, .io. When to Escalate ICANN escalations are possible when a Registrar is being unresponsive. Requirements : ✅ Domain involves clear infringement (screenshots, URLs, phishing proof). ✅ Case reported through Registrar's proper channels. ✅ Minimum 72 hours have passed since initial report. Timeline ICANN contacts registrar up to 3 times . 15 days wait after each communication. Notice of Breach issued if no response. Average resolution : ~1 month. Last Resort : ICANN escalations should be used as a last resort. If ICANN is unable to resolve, consider UDRP or legal action. UDRP (Uniform Domain-Name Dispute Resolution Policy) The UDRP is a legal framework for resolving disputes between domain name registrants and third-party trademark owners over abusive registration and use of Internet domain names. Reference: WIPO UDRP Guide Key Factors ❌ No money back on failure . ⚠️ Significant effort required to fill submissions and maintain communication. ⏱️ Timeline : 14-30 days. 📋 Requires TM registration . 🎯 Requires proof of unfair usage or at least unfair intent. Requirements To file UDRP, you need: ✅ Trademark Registration Domain must include your registered TM. ✅ Proof of Bad Faith Unfair usage of the domain. Bad faith registration intent. ✅ Evidence Package Comprehensive documentation. Timeline of infringement. Proof of harm. When to Consider UDRP Standard takedown failed. ICANN escalation unsuccessful. Domain clearly includes your registered TM. Registrar unresponsive. Strong evidence of bad faith. Cost Considerations Additional cost (varies by provider). No refund if unsuccessful.

    "content": "Trademark & Copyright Infringement At PhishFort, we protect your brand not only from malicious activity but also from TM and CR infringements. Definitions Trademark A trademark is a distinctive symbol, phrase, or word that identifies a particular product or service. It serves to legally distinguish one offering from others in the marketplace while also acknowledging the ownership of the brand by the respective company. Protects : Brand identity for selling products or services. Copyright Copyright is a legal term used to describe the rights that creators have over their literary and artistic works. Works covered by copyright range from books, music, paintings, sculpture, and films, to computer programs, databases, advertisements, maps, and technical drawings. (Source: WIPO Copyright ) Protects : Creative expressions. Key Distinction : Copyright protects creative expressions, while trademarks protect brand identity. For DMCA takedowns, only copyright-related claims are applicable. What is a DMCA? The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a U.S. law enacted in 1998 to address copyright protection in the digital age. It provides a framework for: Copyright holders to request removal of infringing content. Service providers to be protected from liability if they respond promptly. International Context While DMCA is specific to the U.S., many countries have adopted similar laws under the WIPO Copyright Treaty : European Union : EU Copyright Directive. Other jurisdictions : Similar frameworks balancing copyright protection with innovation. Types of Infringement Trademark Infringement Occurs when a trademark is used without permission in a way that causes confusion about the source of goods or services. Common Types : Counterfeiting : Unauthorized use on identical/similar goods. Dilution : Weakening famous trademark's uniqueness. Unauthorized Marketing : Using TM without permission for promotion.

    "content": "Search Engine Cache Removal When unwanted or malicious content continues to appear in search results—even in cached form—you can request removal of those cached versions. How Cached Removal Works Prerequisite : Before a search engine will remove a cached page, the content must actually be unavailable on the live site (returns 404 or has been taken down). The Recrawl Process Search engines use bots (crawlers) to discover and index content. When a page is updated/deleted: Crawler must recrawl the page. This can take days or even a week . Depends on site popularity and crawl frequency. Can be expedited with cache-specific reports. Evidence Requirements ✅ Exact URL as it appears in search results. ✅ Search Engine Name (Google, Bing, etc.). ✅ Cached-Page URL (if available). Important : Report each cached link as a separate incident (one URL = one incident), even if same search term appears across multiple engines. Best Practices ✅ Ensure live page is already down/removed. ✅ Submit to each search engine separately. ✅ Include exact cached URL when available. ✅ Provide context about the original takedown. ❌ Don't submit while live page is still active. ❌ Don't expect instant removal. ❌ Don't bundle multiple URLs in one report.

    "content": "Social Media Platforms Social media platforms can vary significantly in their level of cooperation when handling takedown requests. While some may act swiftly on clear evidence of phishing or malicious activity, others may require extensive documentation and context to act. Our requests for specific evidence are not arbitrary but rather the result of carefully tested approaches aimed at increasing the likelihood of success. General Requirements for All Social Media Platforms Key Evidence Required 1. Letter of Authorization (LOA) The LOA allows PhishFort to act on behalf of the client for Trademark / Copyright / DMCA infringement cases. What LOA Should Include : Original URLs protected by PhishFort. Company registration number and jurisdiction. Registration numbers and jurisdictions of copyrights and trademarks. Associated brands (if applicable). More complete = Better success rate The more complete the LOA document, the better chances we have to achieve a successful takedown. 2. Detailed Explanation of the Infringement Context is crucial to report the correct type of infringement. Our analysts need a good understanding of the case to evaluate it and submit a compelling report. What to Include : Type of violation (impersonation, TM, copyright, phishing). How it harms your brand. How users might be confused. Any customer complaints or reports. Sending just a link or an image without explanation will not suffice. 3. The Original/Legitimate Profile (If Available) Providing the real profile being impersonated helps us prove which is legitimate. Benefits : Shorter takedown time. Higher success rate. Clearer comparison for platform reviewers. Platform-Specific Guides Each platform has unique policies and requirements. Select your platform below for detailed guidance: Major Platforms Direct links to infringement, legitimate profile, LOA. Special handling for comments and posts.

    "content": "TikTok Takedowns TikTok has specific requirements that differ from other platforms. They will not act on reports for profiles with a brand's name alone. Critical : TikTok only acts on accounts with an infringing post . Without a post, takedowns cannot be executed. Evidence Requirements Mandatory Evidence ✅ Letter of Authorization (LOA) ✅ Legitimate Profile (MANDATORY) If your legitimate TikTok profile doesn't exist, let us know. We can execute the takedown but with a different process and escalation system. ✅ Link to the Infringing TikTok Post Must be a specific post, not just the profile. Profile name alone is not enough. Optional But Recommended Screenshots of the infringing post. Context about the violation. Evidence of customer confusion. Types of Violations Infringing Posts (Actionable) Posts using your brand assets without permission. Posts claiming false affiliation. Posts with copyrighted content. Posts impersonating your customer service. Profile Name Only (NOT Actionable) TikTok does NOT take down profiles based solely on: Profile name containing your brand. Bio mentioning your brand (without false claims in posts). Profile picture similarity. Key Difference from Other Platforms : TikTok requires evidence of violation in actual posts/videos, not just profile information. Best Practices ✅ Find specific posts that violate policies. ✅ Provide legitimate profile for comparison. ✅ Explain how the post causes harm. ✅ Include customer reports if available. ❌ Don't report profile name alone. ❌ Don't submit without LOA. ❌ Don't submit without legitimate profile link.

Critical Requirement : X/Twitter impersonation must meet at least 2 of the following criteria: Display name. Profile description. Impersonating post. If these criteria are not met, they will reject the takedown. Strict Impersonation Definition What Counts for Impersonation ✅ Counts ❌ Does NOT Count Display name (the name shown on profile). Username (@handle). Profile description (bio). Impersonating post (must provide link). Important : The username (@handle) is not considered for impersonation on Twitter/X! Only the display name, bio, and posts matter. Evidence Requirements Mandatory Evidence ✅ Letter of Authorization (LOA) ✅ Meet 2+ Impersonation Criteria Display name uses your brand. Profile description claims affiliation. Posts claim to represent your brand. ✅ Context and Brief Description Type of impersonation. How it harms your brand. Any customer reports. Optional But Recommended Legitimate Profile (helpful but optional for impersonation). Screenshots showing: Profile with display name visible. Bio/description. Impersonating posts.

Profile Impersonation Qualifying Example (meets 2+ criteria): ✅ Display name: \"CustomerSupport BrandName\". ✅ Bio: \"Official support for BrandName products\". Profile picture: Generic image (not your logo).

    "content": "Bulk Reporting For certain social media platforms, we offer bulk reporting functionality. Requirements All of the following must be met: ✅ Same Platform All URLs must be from the same platform. ✅ Same Brand/Person Targeted All incidents target the same brand or person. ✅ Similar/Same Attack Pattern Example: All are fake customer support accounts. Supported Platforms Facebook. Instagram. Scribd. GitBook. Teachable. Telegram. This list is not exhaustive. If unsure whether bulk reporting is supported for a specific platform, contact PhishFort Support. How to Submit Bulk Incidents Submission Format You may include up to 10 URLs : 1 primary URL in the incident form. Up to 9 additional URLs in the incident comments. Process Create incident with type set to \"social\" . Add primary URL in the main form. Add remaining URLs (up to 9) in comments. Provide evidence for all reported cases. How We Evaluate Success Success Criteria ✅ At least 1 URL successfully taken down = Incident marked successful. ❌ No URLs successful = Incident not marked successful. Failed URLs Our Operations team will notify you of failed URLs. Resubmit failed URLs in new incident for another attempt. Cannot re-report in bulk - must be individual incidents. Important Limitations ⚠️ Domain Bulk Reporting NOT Available Important : Bulk reporting of domains is not available at this time. Do NOT include domain-level takedown requests in bulk social submissions. Each domain must be submitted as a separate incident. Best Practices ✅ Do This Verify all URLs are from same platform. Ensure same attack pattern. Provide evidence for each URL. Submit as \"social\" incident type. Include context in comments. ❌ Don't Do This Don't mix platforms in one submission. Don't exceed 10 URLs. Don't include domains in social bulk reports. Don't resubmit failed URLs in bulk again. Don't submit without evidence.

    "content": "Fake News In cases involving suspected fake news, it is important to note that such material is often hosted on legitimate news platforms and distributed across multiple credible sources. Important : Requests to remove news content are generally declined by hosting providers and authorities unless supported by compelling legal documentation. When Takedowns Are Possible Takedown efforts for news articles and editorial content are typically only successful when one of the following conditions is met: 1. Verifiable Evidence ✅ Clear demonstration that the content is false or misleading. 2. Court Order ✅ Court order issued by a competent legal authority mandating removal. Evidence Requirements ✅ Fact-Based Rebuttal Correction from credible source. Demonstrates claims are false or misleading. ✅ Official Statements Press releases from client or relevant authorities. Disproves reported information. ✅ Screenshots/Archives Including timestamps. Preserve the version in question. ✅ Evidence of Harm Reputational damage. Financial loss. Legal consequences. ✅ Statements from Affected Individuals Company representatives refuting content. ✅ Court Order or Legal Opinion (if available) States content constitutes defamation or misinformation. Why Takedowns Are Difficult Press Freedom Protections Hosting providers respect editorial independence. Platforms protect journalistic content. Legal frameworks favor free speech. Legitimate Platform Hosting News sites are credible, established platforms. Not the same as phishing or malicious sites. Require stronger legal justification. Recommended Approach Legal Consultation : We advise clients to consult with their legal teams to assess the possibility of pursuing a court order. This approach offers the most reliable path to achieving content removal in fake news cases. Alternative Actions While pursuing takedown: Issue official rebuttals. Contact platform directly.

    "content": "Scams A scam incident occurs when a website or its content appears legitimate, but the advertised service is not delivered. Simple Example : If you pay for a coffee but receive only water or nothing at all, that is a scam. Challenge with Scam Cases In general, scams do not target our customers directly, but they can still be affected by them. Difficulty : Obtaining proof can be challenging, which limits our possible courses of action and might affect our ability to take them down. Evidence Requirements ✅ Context Describing the Scam How the scam works. What is promised vs. what is delivered. ✅ Evidence of Purchased Services/Goods Specifically, the text used to scam contains a clear payment request. Screenshots of the offer. Transaction records. ✅ Proof Agreement Was Not Completed No service delivered. Counterfeit goods delivered. Service different from what was promised. Communication proving non-delivery. Types of Scam Evidence Court-Level Evidence (Strongest) For strongest cases, provide: Service Promised : Clear documentation of what was offered. Proof of Transaction : Payment receipts, bank statements, transaction IDs. Proof of Non-Delivery : Shipping records showing nothing sent, or proof item was counterfeit. Customer Reports Multiple victims with same experience. Pattern of non-delivery. Complaints filed with authorities. Platform Violations Terms of service violations. False advertising. Fraudulent claims. Why Proof Is Critical Without clear evidence that: Money was exchanged. Service/goods were promised. Promise was not fulfilled. ...the case appears as a \"he said, she said\" dispute rather than provable fraud. Best Practices ✅ Do This Document everything before purchasing. Screenshot the offer/promises. Keep all communication records. Save payment receipts. Document non-delivery. ❌ Don't Do This Don't report suspicions without evidence. Don't expect takedown without transaction proof. Don't submit without clear scam pattern. Alternative Actions If evidence i"
