# Getting Started with Takedown Requests

## Why is the First Report So Important? {% #why-first-report-matters %}

At PhishFort, we are committed to protecting your brand against phishing attacks and trademark or brand infringements. We aim to ensure your brand and your customers' safety online. With that, we created this guide that outlines the evidence required for different incident types. Your collaboration is invaluable in helping us build strong cases and submit effective takedown reports.

By providing detailed evidence and context, you enable us to act swiftly and decisively against the threats posed by these incidents. Additionally, having this information will help us submit a complete first report quickly and limit any back-and-forth communication or unnecessary delays due to a lack of context.

### Impact of Complete Reports

Submitting a complete and detailed first report is critical to the success of any takedown request. A strong report with the necessary evidence:

- ✅ Increases the likelihood of resolving the issue on the first attempt.
- ✅ Impedes scammers from benefiting from unnecessary delays.
- ✅ Prevents business losses or reputation damage.
- ✅ Streamlines the process and achieves better outcomes.

### When Back-and-Forth is Unavoidable

{% callout type="warning" %}
In some instances—especially with complex phishing attacks—additional back-and-forth may be unavoidable to fully understand the context of the incident. This is normal and helps us build the strongest possible case.

By ensuring the initial report is thorough, we can streamline the process and achieve better outcomes. Together, we can safeguard your brand's reputation and minimize the impact of malicious activities.

## What Can and Cannot Be Taken Down? {% #what-can-and-cannot-be-taken-down %}

Before jumping into the evidence we need, let's review what can and cannot be taken down.

### What CANNOT Be Taken Down? {% #cannot-be-taken-down %}

Although our mission is to protect brands and customers from cyberattacks, it is important to know that not all content can be taken down from the internet. Certain types of content are protected from takedowns, depending on jurisdiction and specific legal frameworks.

Generally, we cannot perform takedowns of content that:
- Does not involve illegal activities.
- Is considered trademark fair use.
- Falls under protected speech or editorial content.

Before proceeding with a takedown, even if it is reported by the customer, our analysts need to determine whether it is a phishing case or a trademark/copyright infringement incident.

#### Common Cases That Cannot Be Taken Down

{% callout type="note" %}
These cases cannot be taken down **without additional signs of malicious activity**
{% /callout %}

- **Empty websites with no typosquat**.
- **Parked domains with typosquat** - Not being used for fraudulent activities or trademark infringement. PhishFort can monitor these domains to act accordingly if content is uploaded. Some registrars may agree to turn off parked pages if typosquat is not generic.
- **Tutorial websites** - Sites that clearly state they are not related to the customer and provide guides to earn from ads (considered legal activity).
- **Genuine product sales** - Websites selling clients' products that are genuine/original and comply with the First Sale Doctrine.
- **Fair Use content** - All content in social media and websites that falls under the [Fair Use doctrine](legal/fair-use).
- **Non-violating platform content** - Content that does not violate social media platform policies, even if somewhat harmful to the brand.
- **Legitimate businesses** - Legit businesses with Trademark or Copyright disputes.
- **Doxxing cases** - Not typically actionable through standard takedown processes.
- **Public information** - Information considered to be in the public domain.
- **Non-typosquatting TM violations** - Domains without typosquatting where content violates Trademark (we can get content removed, but not always take down the website).

{% callout type="tip" %}
For cases with limited evidence, provide as much context as possible. This allows our analysts to examine the case from different angles and find possible platform policy violations that lead to content removal.

### What CAN Be Taken Down? {% #can-be-taken-down %}

A **takedown** is a request issued to an ISP, web host, social media company, domain registrar, or mobile app store operator to remove malicious or fraudulent content or domains abusing your company's brand.

We will perform takedowns for:
- Malicious domains using your brand (e.g., phishing sites).
- Someone impersonating your brand.
- Unauthorized mobile apps mimicking your apps.
- Any content that targets your brand and violates specific platform rules.

#### Specific Takedown Types

**Domains**

All domains with phishing content are susceptible to being taken down. However, domains with typosquatting alone are usually not taken down by Registrars as the website must contain malicious content or brand abuse to qualify.

**Emails**

We can facilitate the takedown of email addresses involved in any type of cyber attack or malicious activity, effectively disrupting their use and mitigating potential harm.

**Social Media & Messaging Platforms**

We can report and take down accounts with different types of infringements:
- Trademark violation.
- Copyright abuse.
- Impersonation.

Each platform's policies will determine what can or cannot be taken down. Our analysts are specialists in social media policies and will decide on the best approach for each case.
