# Google Ads Impersonations and Malicious Landing Pages

PhishFort can carry out takedowns for malicious ads and landing pages.

{% callout type="warning" %}
**Important**: Submit as **two separate incidents**:
1. One for the ad
2. One for the landing page
{% /callout %}

## Evidence Requirements

### Mandatory

✅ **Ad URL**
✅ **Landing Page URL**
✅ **Screenshot** of search results showing impersonation

### Additional (Strengthens Case)

- Date and time the ad appeared.
- GCLID values.
- IP addresses associated with the attack.

## Best Practices

✅ Screenshot the entire search result page.
✅ Include your ad position vs. the malicious ad.
✅ Show how users could be confused.
✅ Provide geo-location if ad is region-specific.
