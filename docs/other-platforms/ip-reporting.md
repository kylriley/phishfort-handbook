# IP Reporting

Reporting IPs requires extra care and detailed evidence due to the complexities of their use.

{% callout type="warning" %}
**Important**: Many IP addresses host multiple websites, and not all may be malicious.

Domain-level takedowns are usually **more effective** than targeting entire IPs.
{% /callout %}

## Evidence Requirements

✅ **Specific URL Evidence**
- Always provide a specific URL associated with the malicious activity hosted on the IP.

✅ **Detailed Explanation**
- Describe how the content is harmful or infringing.
- Include proof of malicious activity (phishing, malware, impersonation).

## Domain vs. IP Considerations

{% callout type="tip" %}
**Best Practice**: If the same domain is used across multiple IPs, prioritize reporting the **domain** rather than the IPs.

When a TLD is taken down, it cannot change IPs to be up again.
{% /callout %}

### When to Report IPs
- Single-IP hosting with multiple malicious domains.
- Infrastructure hosting only malicious content.
- When domain takedowns have failed.

### When NOT to Report IPs
- IP hosts legitimate websites alongside malicious ones.
- Domain-level takedown is possible.
- Risk of collateral damage to legitimate sites.

## Malware & Sensitive Content

{% callout type="danger" %}
Cases involving **malware** or **NSFW material** demand heightened attention.

Please clearly flag these cases when reporting so our analysts can prioritize and handle appropriately.
{% /callout %}
