# APK Cases

An APK is an app hosted outside official distribution platforms like Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

{% callout type="note" %}
**Important**: APK cases are treated as **DMCA takedowns**.

This means we do **not** require trademark registrations as evidence. Instead, we need proof of copyright violation.
{% /callout %}

## Evidence Requirements

✅ **Letter of Authorization (LOA)**

✅ **Proof of Copyright Violation**
- Evidence that the client's copyright is being infringed.

✅ **Client Relationship Evidence**
- For sub-clients: proof of legal relationship between partner and end customer.
- For sub-brands: reference to parent company (mention on website/official app).

✅ **For Malicious APKs**:
- Screenshots of phishing behavior.
- Requests for sensitive information (wallet credentials, banking details).
- Malware analysis (if available).

✅ **Link to Original APK** (if screenshots unavailable).

## Important Notes

{% callout type="warning" %}
**File vs. Page Takedown**: In general, the takedown is performed on the **file itself** by removing it.

The informational page might not be taken down and may remain active.
{% /callout %}

APK takedowns often require more back-and-forth communication as:
- Apps aren't always inherently malicious.
- Some are distributed for device compatibility.
- Proving infringement can be challenging.
