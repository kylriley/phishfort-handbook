# WhatsApp Takedowns

## Evidence Requirements

### Mandatory Evidence

✅ **Letter of Authorization (LOA)**

✅ **Phone Number in wa.me Format**
- Format: `wa.me/phonenumber`.
- Example: `wa.me/1234567890`.

{% callout type="warning" %}
**Important**: Sharing the contact directly (e.g., via vCard or "Share Contact" option) is **not** sufficient for reporting.
{% /callout %}

✅ **Screenshots with Evidence**
- Clear screenshots capturing the infringement
- Messages impersonating the client or showing malicious activity
- Timestamps visible

### Optional But Recommended
- Context about the scam or impersonation.
- Customer reports or complaints.
- Pattern of behavior (if multiple users affected).

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ **Don't share contacts via vCard** - Use wa.me format.
- ❌ **Don't provide just phone number** - Include wa.me URL.
- ❌ **Screenshots without context** - Explain the violation.

{% callout type="note" %}
**Important**: Screenshots showing group member lists or participant details do not necessarily strengthen the case if the rest of the evidence is not provided.
{% /callout %}
