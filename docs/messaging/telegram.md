# Telegram Takedowns

Telegram presents unique challenges when performing takedowns, as it often ignores standard infringement reports.

{% callout type="warning" %}
**Platform Limitation**: In general, Telegram only takes quick action in cases involving **severe violations**, such as illegal content.

Brand impersonation or phishing reports are generally low-priority unless overwhelming evidence is provided.
{% /callout %}

## Success Rates

Overall success rates for Telegram vary depending on:
- Type of infringement.
- Quality of evidence.
- How the reported infringement violates Telegram's fair use policies.

Telegram operates with a very loose enforcement mandate, which our team continuously manages and files escalations for on behalf of customers.

## Evidence by Type

### Message

✅ **Required**:
- Link to the message.
- Screenshots showing undeniable evidence of the violation.
- Include timestamps and dates.
- Context about it.

### Group

- ✅ Document harm to users.
- ✅ Include customer complaints.
- ❌ Don't expect quick action.
- ❌ Don't rely on brand name alone.
