# Social Media Platforms

Social media platforms can vary significantly in their level of cooperation when handling takedown requests. While some may act swiftly on clear evidence of phishing or malicious activity, others may require extensive documentation and context to act.

Our requests for specific evidence are not arbitrary but rather the result of carefully tested approaches aimed at increasing the likelihood of success.

## General Requirements for All Social Media Platforms

### Key Evidence Required

#### 1. Letter of Authorization (LOA) {% #loa %}

The LOA allows PhishFort to act on behalf of the client for Trademark / Copyright / DMCA infringement cases.

**What LOA Should Include**:
- Original URLs protected by PhishFort.
- Company registration number and jurisdiction.
- Registration numbers and jurisdictions of copyrights and trademarks.
- Associated brands (if applicable).

{% callout type="tip" %}
**More complete = Better success rate**

The more complete the LOA document, the better chances we have to achieve a successful takedown.
{% /callout %}

#### 2. Detailed Explanation of the Infringement

Context is crucial to report the correct type of infringement. Our analysts need a good understanding of the case to evaluate it and submit a compelling report.

**What to Include**:
- Type of violation (impersonation, TM, copyright, phishing).
- How it harms your brand.
- How users might be confused.
- Any customer complaints or reports.

{% callout type="warning" %}
Sending just a link or an image without explanation will **not** suffice.
{% /callout %}

#### 3. The Original/Legitimate Profile (If Available)

Providing the real profile being impersonated helps us prove which is legitimate.

**Benefits**:
- Shorter takedown time.
- Higher success rate.
- Clearer comparison for platform reviewers.

## Best Practices for Social Media Takedowns

### ✅ Do This

1. **Provide Direct Links**
   - Link to specific posts, profiles, or comments.
   - Don't just provide screenshots without URLs.

2. **Hide, Don't Delete Comments**
   - For Facebook comments, hide them instead of deleting.
   - This preserves evidence for platform authorities.

3. **Document Everything**
   - Screenshots with timestamps.
   - URLs visible in screenshots.
   - Date/time of observation.

4. **Explain the Context**
   - Why it's harmful.
   - How users might be confused.
   - Any customer reports.

### ❌ Don't Do This

1. **Don't Submit Without Context**
   - Never just send a link.
   - Always explain the violation.

2. **Don't Delete Evidence**
   - Keep original content accessible.
   - Don't block accounts before reporting.

3. **Don't Submit Too Soon**
   - Ensure you have complete evidence.
   - Have LOA ready before submission.

4. **Don't Expect Uniform Results**
   - Each platform is different.
   - Some require more evidence than others.

## When Platforms Reject Takedowns

If a takedown is rejected, it doesn't mean the case is over. Common rejection reasons:

### 1. Insufficient Evidence
**Solution**: Provide more context, screenshots, or proof of harm.

### 2. Doesn't Violate Platform Policy
**Solution**: Reframe the violation to match platform terms, or provide additional evidence showing policy violation.

### 3. Falls Under Fair Use
**Solution**: Demonstrate how it goes beyond fair use (e.g., creates consumer confusion).

### 4. LOA Issues
**Solution**: Update LOA with proper authorizations and registrations.
