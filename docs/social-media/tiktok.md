# TikTok Takedowns

TikTok has specific requirements that differ from other platforms. They will **not** act on reports for profiles with a brand's name alone.

{% callout type="warning" %}
**Critical**: TikTok only acts on accounts with an **infringing post**. Without a post, takedowns cannot be executed.
{% /callout %}

## Evidence Requirements

### Mandatory Evidence

✅ **Letter of Authorization (LOA)**

✅ **Legitimate Profile (MANDATORY)**
- If your legitimate TikTok profile doesn't exist, let us know.
- We can execute the takedown but with a different process and escalation system.

✅ **Link to the Infringing TikTok Post**
- Must be a specific post, not just the profile.
- Profile name alone is not enough.

### Optional But Recommended
- Screenshots of the infringing post.
- Context about the violation.
- Evidence of customer confusion.

## Types of Violations

### Infringing Posts (Actionable)
- Posts using your brand assets without permission.
- Posts claiming false affiliation.
- Posts with copyrighted content.
- Posts impersonating your customer service.

### Profile Name Only (NOT Actionable)
TikTok does NOT take down profiles based solely on:
- Profile name containing your brand.
- Bio mentioning your brand (without false claims in posts).
- Profile picture similarity.

{% callout type="tip" %}
**Key Difference from Other Platforms**: TikTok requires evidence of violation in actual posts/videos, not just profile information.
{% /callout %}

## Best Practices

✅ Find specific posts that violate policies.
✅ Provide legitimate profile for comparison.
✅ Explain how the post causes harm.
✅ Include customer reports if available.

❌ Don't report profile name alone.
❌ Don't submit without LOA.
❌ Don't submit without legitimate profile link.
