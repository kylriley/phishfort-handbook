# Facebook Takedowns

When dealing with Facebook cases, it's important to obtain a direct link to the infringement. This can be highly beneficial depending on the situation at hand.

---

## Evidence Requirements

### Mandatory Evidence

✅ **Letter of Authorization (LOA)**
- [Learn about LOA requirements →](/social-media#loa)

✅ **URL or Screenshot of Infringement**
- Profile URL for impersonation.
- Direct link to posts or comments.
- Screenshots if links unavailable.

✅ **Context Related to the Case**
- Type of violation.
- How it harms your brand.
- Any customer reports.

### Optional But Recommended

- **Legitimate Profile** (for impersonation cases).
- Additional screenshots showing:
  - Timeline of violations.
  - Multiple violations.
  - User engagement/confusion.

---

## Getting Direct Links to Infringement

### For Profile Impersonation
Simply copy the profile URL from the address bar.

**Example**: `https://www.facebook.com/fake.profile.name`

### For Posts
1. Click the timestamp/date on the post.
2. Copy the URL from the address bar.

**Example**: `https://www.facebook.com/profile/posts/123456789`

### For Comments

{% callout type="tip" %}
**Important**: For comments, **hide** them instead of deleting!

This makes evidence more accessible to Facebook's authorities while preventing further harm.
{% /callout %}

**How to hide and link to comments**:
1. Click the three dots (•••) on the comment.
2. Select "Hide comment".
3. Right-click the timestamp.
4. Select "Copy link".
5. Share this link in your report.

**Example**: `https://www.facebook.com/profile/posts/123456789?comment_id=987654321`

### If Links Aren't Available

Provide clear screenshots that show:
- Full URL in address bar.
- Date/time stamp.
- The infringing content.
- Engagement metrics (if relevant).

## Types of Facebook Violations

### 1. Profile Impersonation

**What Qualifies**:
- Using your logo as profile/cover photo.
- Using your brand name as the page name.
- Claiming to be official support/customer service.
- Impersonating executives or employees.

**Evidence Needed**:
- URL of fake profile.
- URL of legitimate profile (if available).
- Screenshots showing impersonation.
- LOA.

---

### 2. Page Impersonation

**What Qualifies**:
- Fake business pages.
- Pages claiming official affiliation.
- Pages using your branding.

**Evidence Needed**:
- URL of fake page.
- URL of legitimate page.
- Screenshots showing violations.
- LOA.

{% callout type="warning" %}
**Important**: Unofficial, automatically generated Facebook business location pages are NOT infringements.

These are clearly marked as unofficial and are not used for malicious activity. Therefore, they **cannot** be taken down.
{% /callout %}

---

### 3. Post/Content Violations

**What Qualifies**:
- Posts with copyrighted content.
- Posts making false claims about your brand.
- Posts using your TM without authorization.
- Phishing links in posts.

**Evidence Needed**:
- Direct link to the post.
- Screenshot of the post.
- Explanation of the violation.
- LOA (for TM/Copyright).

---

### 4. Comment Violations

**What Qualifies**:
- Spam comments with malicious links.
- Comments impersonating customer service.
- Scam comments targeting your customers.

**Evidence Needed**:
- Link to the comment (after hiding it).
- Screenshot showing the comment.
- Context about the scam.
- LOA.

**Best Practice**: Hide the comment first, then get the link, then report.

---

## Facebook-Specific Considerations

### Pre-Made Location Pages

Facebook automatically generates business location pages based on public data. These pages:

- Are clearly marked as "unofficial".
- Show "This is not an official page".
- Are not used for malicious activity.
- **Cannot be taken down** through standard processes.

{% callout type="note" %}
**Alternative**: If you want control over these pages, claim them through Facebook's official business verification process rather than requesting takedowns.
{% /callout %}

---

### Response Times

- **Profile impersonation**: 24-72 hours typically.
- **Copyright violations**: 24-48 hours (with DMCA).
- **Trademark violations**: 48-96 hours.
- **Comments**: 12-48 hours.

{% callout type="note" %}
These are typical response times. Actual times vary based on case complexity and evidence quality.
{% /callout %}

## Common Rejection Reasons

### Insufficient Evidence
**Problem**: Only provided a link without context

**Solution**: Add detailed explanation of:
- Why it violates policies.
- How it harms your brand.
- How users could be confused.

### Doesn't Violate Community Standards
**Problem**: Content doesn't explicitly violate Facebook's policies

**Solution**: Reframe as:
- Trademark violation (with LOA and TM registration).
- Impersonation (with clearer evidence).
- Copyright violation (with DMCA documentation).

### LOA Missing or Incomplete
**Problem**: Letter of Authorization not provided or missing key information

**Solution**: Submit complete LOA with:
- Company registration details.
- Trademark/Copyright registrations.
- Authorization to act on behalf.

### Legitimate Business Confusion
**Problem**: Facebook thinks it might be a legitimate reseller or partner

**Solution**: Clarify that:
- There's no partnership.
- No authorization given.
- It creates consumer confusion.

## Best Practices for Facebook Takedowns

### ✅ Do This

1. **Get Direct Links When Possible**
   - Profiles, posts, comments.
   - Makes verification easier.

2. **Hide Comments Before Reporting**
   - Prevents deletion of evidence.
   - Stops further harm.
   - Allows Facebook to review.

3. **Provide Legitimate Profile**
   - Shows clear comparison.
   - Proves ownership.
   - Increases success rate.

4. **Include Timestamps**
   - When you observed the violation.
   - When it was first reported to you.
   - Shows timeline of harm.

### ❌ Don't Do This

1. **Don't Delete Comments**
   - Destroys evidence.
   - Use hide function instead.

2. **Don't Block the Account First**
   - Makes it harder to gather evidence.
   - Report first, block after.

3. **Don't Submit Just Screenshots**
   - Always try to get direct links.
   - Screenshots are supplementary.

4. **Don't Expect Instant Removal**
   - Facebook needs time to review.
   - Repeated submissions don't speed it up.

## Escalation Process

If your initial report is rejected or ignored:

1. **Review the Evidence**
   - Is it complete?
   - Is the violation clear?
   - Is the LOA proper?

2. **Strengthen the Case**
   - Add more context.
   - Provide additional evidence.
   - Get customer complaint examples.

3. **Resubmit with Improvements**
   - Explain why previous rejection was incorrect.
   - Provide new evidence.
   - Reframe the violation if needed.

4. **Use Facebook's Appeal Process**
   - If you have a verified business page.
   - Use Facebook Business Support.
   - Reference previous case numbers.
