# LinkedIn Takedowns

LinkedIn takedown cases often require detailed evidence and context to ensure successful resolution.

## Types of Violations

### 1. False Information
Incorrect details in the "Experience" section, such as false employment claims.

**Can be removed**: False employment claims in Experience section.
**Cannot be removed**: Profile descriptions (typically).

### 2. Scams
Individuals impersonating someone else or fraudulently associating themselves with a company.

## Evidence Requirements

### Key Evidence Needed

✅ **Location of the Infringement**
- Identify where the violation occurs (specific section of profile or company page).

✅ **Nature of the Harm**
- Explain who is affected and how the content is causing damage.

✅ **Reason for the Report**
- Concise explanation of why the content affects your brand.
- Link it to a violation of LinkedIn's policies (impersonation, fraudulent claims).

✅ **Letter of Authorization (LOA)**

✅ **Direct Link to the Profile/Page**
- Exact URL of the content being reported.

✅ **Impersonation Proof**
- Link to the real profile or page of the person/company being mimicked.

### For Employee Impersonation
If impersonation involves a client employee, we might need:
- Proof of employment.
- Letter from HR or management.
- Official company statement.

## Specific Cases

### Pre-Made Pages
{% callout type="warning" %}
The platform rejects takedown attempts of pre-made pages.

**Alternative**: Claim ownership through LinkedIn's process for associating a page with the primary company profile.
{% /callout %}

### False Information in Experience
LinkedIn allows removal of false details in the "Experience" section.

**Example**: Someone falsely claiming to work at your company.

**Important Note**: Descriptions in profiles typically cannot be removed.

### Individual Posts
Not typically taken down unless explicit violation of LinkedIn's content guidelines (e.g., phishing or malicious content).

### Scam or Impersonation
Highlight how the profile/page is:
- Pretending to be someone.
- Falsely claiming association with a company.

## Response Times
- Typically 7-14 days.
- Complex cases may take longer.
- Appeals can add 7-10 days.
