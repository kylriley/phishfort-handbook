# What Makes Evidence Stronger, and What is Not Actionable

Understanding what constitutes strong evidence versus counter-evidence is crucial for successful takedown requests. This guide helps you distinguish between actionable violations and legitimate use cases.

---

## Brand Impersonation {% #brand-impersonation %}

**Brand impersonation**, or brand spoofing, is a phishing tactic that involves cybercriminals falsely representing themselves as your organization or one of your organization's employees.

### Evidence vs. Counter Evidence

| ✅ Strong Evidence | ❌ Not Actionable / Counter Evidence |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Usage of the victim logo as its own logo. | Having own logo / using victim logo somewhere in content. |
| Use client name as own in page title, main header, footer (c). | Mention brand as category or subpage related to service provided. |
| Clearly state to be official support / helpdesk / other department of victim brand. | Say that they can help with something, without pretending to be official Representative. |
| Account use name/photo/position of official employee. | Former worker; Same name, but not related. |
| | Competitors or similar businesses, especially when brand name is very generic. |

{% callout type="warning" %}
**Key Distinction**: Brand impersonation requires the bad actor to actively **pretend to BE** the brand, not just mention or reference it.

## Trademark and Copyright Infringements {% #trademark-copyright-infringements %}

TM/CR infringements are **not** part of brand impersonation (as impersonation is malicious and more powerful evidence). In summary, trademark and copyright infringements include all uses that are not "fair" or "nominative" use.

{% /callout %}

### Fair Trademark Usage

For usage to qualify as **fair trademark use**:

1. The use of the plaintiff's mark is necessary to describe their goods or services.
2. They use only as much of the mark as is necessary to describe the product.
3. Their conduct reflects the accurate relationship they have with the plaintiff.

### Nominative Trademark Usage

For **nominative trademark usage**, the following elements must be present:

- The use must accurately refer to the owner of the trademark or the goods/services sold under the trademark (cannot be misleading or defamatory).
- The use must not imply any endorsement or sponsorship by the trademark owner.
- There should be no easier way to refer to the owner or its products.
- Only so much of the trademark can be used as is needed to identify the trademark owner and no more.
