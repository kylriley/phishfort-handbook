# Scams

A scam incident occurs when a website or its content appears legitimate, but the advertised service is not delivered.

**Simple Example**: If you pay for a coffee but receive only water or nothing at all, that is a scam.

## Challenge with Scam Cases

In general, scams do not target our customers directly, but they can still be affected by them.

**Difficulty**: Obtaining proof can be challenging, which limits our possible courses of action and might affect our ability to take them down.

## Evidence Requirements

✅ **Context Describing the Scam**
- How the scam works.
- What is promised vs. what is delivered.

✅ **Evidence of Purchased Services/Goods**
- Specifically, the text used to scam contains a clear payment request.
- Screenshots of the offer.
- Transaction records.

✅ **Proof Agreement Was Not Completed**
- No service delivered.
- Counterfeit goods delivered.
- Service different from what was promised.
- Communication proving non-delivery.

## Types of Scam Evidence

### Court-Level Evidence (Strongest)

For strongest cases, provide:
- **Service Promised**: Clear documentation of what was offered.
- **Proof of Transaction**: Payment receipts, bank statements, transaction IDs.
- **Proof of Non-Delivery**: Shipping records showing nothing sent, or proof item was counterfeit.

### Customer Reports

- Multiple victims with same experience.
- Pattern of non-delivery.
- Complaints filed with authorities.

### Platform Violations

- Terms of service violations.
- False advertising.
- Fraudulent claims.

## Why Proof Is Critical

Without clear evidence that:
1. Money was exchanged.
2. Service/goods were promised.
3. Promise was not fulfilled.

...the case appears as a "he said, she said" dispute rather than provable fraud.

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This
- Document everything before purchasing.
- Screenshot the offer/promises.
- Keep all communication records.
- Save payment receipts.
- Document non-delivery.

### ❌ Don't Do This
- Don't report suspicions without evidence.
- Don't expect takedown without transaction proof.
- Don't submit without clear scam pattern.

## Alternative Actions

If evidence is insufficient for takedown:
- Report to consumer protection agencies.
- File complaints with payment processors.
- Warn customers publicly.
- Report to platform's fraud team.
- Consider legal action.
