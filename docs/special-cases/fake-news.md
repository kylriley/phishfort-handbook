## When Takedowns Are Possible

Takedown efforts for news articles and editorial content are typically only successful when one of the following conditions is met:

### 1. Verifiable Evidence

✅ Court order issued by a competent legal authority mandating removal.

## Evidence Requirements

✅ **Fact-Based Rebuttal**

- Demonstrates claims are false or misleading.

✅ **Official Statements**
- Press releases from client or relevant authorities.
- Disproves reported information.

✅ **Screenshots/Archives**
- Including timestamps.

## Why Takedowns Are Difficult

### Press Freedom Protections

- Not the same as phishing or malicious sites.
- Require stronger legal justification.
