# Domain Incidents

Attacks using malicious or deceitful domains are a significant portion of what we deal with in the brand protection environment. A single domain can host multiple types of violations, and depending on the violation, the required evidence might change.

{% callout type="tip" %}
**Most Important**: Provide steps to reproduce the attack (Live Proof) so our analysts can easily access the domain and gather further information.
{% /callout %}

## Essential Evidence for All Domain Cases

When reporting a domain incident, provide:

### 1. Direct Links with Evidence
Provide links with evidence of the infringement, such as:
- Payment tracking numbers leading to pages with violations.
- Specific paths showing malicious content.
- Direct URLs to phishing forms.

### 2. Screenshots
Screenshots showing:
- Phishing forms or other harmful content.
- **Full URL visible** in the address bar.
- **Date and time visible** (important for verification).

### 3. Context About the Case
Describe:
- How it was discovered.
- Where it was found (search engine, email, social media, etc.).
- Device and browser used.
- Location/IP used to access.
- Any other relevant details.

### 4. Geo-Fencing Information
If you suspect the attack is geo-fenced (only visible from certain locations), also provide:
- Browser used.
- Geographic location.
- Device type (desktop/mobile).
- IP address if available.

## Quick Summary: Minimum Evidence Required

{% callout type="check" %}
For all domain-related cases, you must provide:

1. **Full URL** (e.g., `www.example.com/attack1/brand2`)
2. **Screenshots** showing the infringement with date, time, and full URL
3. **Case description** (context, how found, relevant details)
4. **Location, device, and browser** used to observe the attack
{% /callout %}

Once submitted, an analyst may contact you for additional details if necessary.

## Types of Domain-Related Incidents

### 1. Website Brand Impersonation {% #website-impersonation %}

This occurs when the domain **pretends to be** the victim's brand, for example, by claiming to be the "official" website.

#### Evidence Required:
- ✅ Screenshots of the webpage showing brand assets and the full URL.
- ✅ Screenshots of any statements from the attacker claiming to represent the brand.
- ✅ Context about how users might be confused.

{% callout type="note" %}
See [Evidence Guidelines](/evidence-guidelines#brand-impersonation) for what constitutes strong impersonation evidence vs. mere brand mention.
{% /callout %}

---

### 2. Email Attacks Using Similar Domains {% #email-domains %}

It's crucial to differentiate between:

#### A. Malicious Domains Registered for Attacks
Example: `support@exampleattack.com`

**Takedown target**: The domain itself (through the Registrar)

#### B. Attacks Through Legitimate Mail Services
Example: `supportbrand@gmail.com`

**Takedown target**: The account (through the platform, e.g., Gmail)

#### Evidence Required:
- ✅ **Email headers** (mandatory) - [See Email Attacks guide →](/email-attacks).
- ✅ Screenshots of the email (optional but helpful).

{% callout type="warning" %}
**Important**: Never forward emails for evidence. Always extract the original email headers. Forwarding replaces the headers with new ones, destroying the evidence.
{% /callout %}

---

### 3. Typosquats or Similar Domains Only {% #typosquats %}

**Typosquats** are domains that mimic legitimate ones to gain legitimacy (e.g., `g00gle.com` instead of `google.com`).

{% callout type="warning" %}
Typosquats alone are **aggravating factors** in impersonation cases, but typosquats **without malicious content** are not enough to execute a takedown.
{% /callout %}

#### When Typosquats CAN Be Taken Down:
- When combined with malicious content.
- When combined with brand impersonation.
- When combined with phishing activity.
- Some registrars may act on non-generic typosquats with clear trademark violations.

#### When Typosquats CANNOT Be Taken Down:
- Parked pages with no content.
- Generic word combinations.
- Legitimate business with historic footprint.
- [Fair use](/legal/fair-use) scenarios.

## ICANN Escalations

If a domain registrar is unresponsive, cases can be escalated to **ICANN** (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).

{% callout type="note" %}
**ICANN Coverage**: ICANN regulates common TLDs like .com, .org, .net.

**NOT Covered**: Country code TLDs (ccTLDs) like .sa, .ru, .fr, .io
{% /callout %}

### Requirements to Escalate to ICANN:

1. ✅ Clear infringement evidence (screenshots, URLs, phishing proof).
2. ✅ Case reported through Registrar's proper channels.
3. ✅ Minimum **72 hours** have passed since initial report.

### ICANN Escalation Timeline:

- ICANN contacts registrar **up to 3 times**.
- **15 days** wait after each communication.
- Total resolution time: **~1 month average**.
- If unsuccessful, consider [UDRP](/legal/icann-udrp) or legal action.

{% callout type="warning" %}
**Last Resort**: ICANN escalations should be used as a last resort when standard takedown processes fail.
{% /callout %}

## Alternative Legal Pathways

### UDRP (Uniform Domain-Name Dispute Resolution Policy)

For cases involving trademark disputes over domain names, UDRP proceedings may be necessary.

**Key considerations**:
- Requires trademark registration.
- Additional cost (no refund on failure).
- Timeline: 14-30 days.
- Requires proof of bad faith registration or unfair usage.
