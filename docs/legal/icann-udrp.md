# ICANN & UDRP

## ICANN Escalations

**ICANN** (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) is a regulatory body for many common Top-Level Domains (TLDs).

### Coverage

- ✅ **Covered TLDs**: .com, .org, .net.
- ❌ **NOT Covered**: Country code TLDs (ccTLDs) like .sa, .ru, .fr, .io.

### When to Escalate

ICANN escalations are possible when a Registrar is being unresponsive.

**Requirements**:
1. ✅ Domain involves clear infringement (screenshots, URLs, phishing proof).
2. ✅ Case reported through Registrar's proper channels.
3. ✅ Minimum **72 hours** have passed since initial report.

### Timeline

1. ICANN contacts registrar **up to 3 times**.
2. **15 days** wait after each communication.
3. Notice of Breach issued if no response.
4. **Average resolution**: ~1 month.

**Last Resort**: ICANN escalations should be used as a last resort.

If ICANN is unable to resolve, consider UDRP or legal action.

## UDRP (Uniform Domain-Name Dispute Resolution Policy)

The UDRP is a legal framework for resolving disputes between domain name registrants and third-party trademark owners over abusive registration and use of Internet domain names.

[Reference: WIPO UDRP Guide](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/guide/#What_is_the)

### Key Factors

- ❌ **No money back on failure**.
- ⚠️ **Significant effort required** to fill submissions and maintain communication.
- ⏱️ **Timeline**: 14-30 days.
- 📋 **Requires TM registration**.
- 🎯 **Requires proof** of unfair usage or at least unfair intent.

### Requirements

To file UDRP, you need:

✅ **Trademark Registration**
- Domain must include your registered TM.

✅ **Proof of Bad Faith**
- Unfair usage of the domain.
- Bad faith registration intent.

✅ **Evidence Package**
- Comprehensive documentation.
- Timeline of infringement.
- Proof of harm.

### When to Consider UDRP

- Standard takedown failed.
- ICANN escalation unsuccessful.
- Domain clearly includes your registered TM.
- Registrar unresponsive.
- Strong evidence of bad faith.

### Cost Considerations

- Additional cost (varies by provider).
- No refund if unsuccessful.
- Legal consultation often needed.
- More expensive than standard takedowns.
