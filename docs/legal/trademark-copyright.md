# Trademark & Copyright Infringement

At PhishFort, we protect your brand not only from malicious activity but also from TM and CR infringements.

## Definitions

### Trademark

A **trademark** is a distinctive symbol, phrase, or word that identifies a particular product or service. It serves to legally distinguish one offering from others in the marketplace while also acknowledging the ownership of the brand by the respective company.

**Protects**: Brand identity for selling products or services.

### Copyright

**Copyright** is a legal term used to describe the rights that creators have over their literary and artistic works. Works covered by copyright range from books, music, paintings, sculpture, and films, to computer programs, databases, advertisements, maps, and technical drawings.

**Protects**: Creative expressions.

**Key Distinction**: Copyright protects creative expressions, while trademarks protect brand identity.

For DMCA takedowns, only copyright-related claims are applicable.

## What is a DMCA?

The **Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)** is a U.S. law enacted in 1998 to address copyright protection in the digital age.

It provides a framework for:
- Copyright holders to request removal of infringing content.
- Service providers to be protected from liability if they respond promptly.

### International Context

While DMCA is specific to the U.S., many countries have adopted similar laws under the [WIPO Copyright Treaty](https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/wct/):
- **European Union**: EU Copyright Directive.
- **Other jurisdictions**: Similar frameworks balancing copyright protection with innovation.
